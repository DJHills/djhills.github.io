Hi, I'm David, a Python focused developer with over 20 years of practical experience in the financial sector.

<p>
I'm based near London (UK).  I studied Software Engineering at <a href="https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/">City St George's, University of London</a>, including a year abroad at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University, NY</a>.  Some years later I additionally studied Financial Engineering at <a href="https://www.bbk.ac.uk/">Birkbeck, University of London</a>.

<p>
During my career I've had the opportunity to work on a range of projects and experience a variety of technologies.  My current interests are Python and AI.
