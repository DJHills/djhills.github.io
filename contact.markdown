Hi, I'm David, a Python focused developer with over 20 years of practical experience in the financial sector.  

I'm based near London (UK).  I studied Software Engineering at [City St George's, University of London](https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/), including a year abroad at [Syracuse University, NY](https://www.syracuse.edu/).  Some years later I additionally studied Financial Engineering at [Birkbeck, University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/).

During my career I've had the opportunity to work on a range of projects and experience a variety of technologies.  My current interests are Python and AI.
